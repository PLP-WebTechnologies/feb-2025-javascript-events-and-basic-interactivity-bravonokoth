## 🧪 What Was Built
The project includes the following features, meeting all requirements and bonus tasks:

### 1. Event Handling 🎈
- **Button Click**: A button changes text content and color of a paragraph.
- **Hover Effects**: Hovering over a paragraph changes its background color.
- **Keypress Detection**: Typing in an input field displays the input in real-time.
- **Bonus**: Double-clicking a button triggers a secret alert action.

### 2. Interactive Elements 🎮
- **Button**: Changes text and color dynamically.
- **Image Slideshow**: A slideshow with next/previous buttons and fade animation using placeholder images.
- **Tabs**: Clickable tabs to show/hide different content sections.
- **Bonus**: Added CSS transitions for smooth slideshow and hover effects.

### 3. Form Validation 📋✅
- **Required Field Checks**: Name field must not be empty.
- **Email Format Validation**: Validates email using a regex pattern.
- **Password Rules**: Password must be at least 8 characters.
- **Bonus**: Real-time feedback on all input fields as the user types.

## 🧙‍♂️ Implementation Details
- **`index.html`**:
  - Semantic HTML5 structure with `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
  - Includes sections for event handling, interactive elements, and form validation.
- **`style.css`**:
  - Responsive design with clean styling.
  - Supports hover effects, tab styling, and slideshow transitions.
- **`script.js`**:
  - Handles all event listeners for clicks, hovers, keypresses, and double-clicks.
  - Implements slideshow logic, tab switching, and form validation with real-time feedback.
  - Clean, commented code for maintainability.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
 
   git clone https://github.com/PLP-WebTechnologies/feb-2025-javascript-events-and-basic-interactivity-bravonokoth.git
Navigate to the project directory:


cd feb-2025-javascript-events-and-basic-interactivity-bravonokoth
Start a local server (requires Node.js or Python):
With Node.js:


npx http-server
With Python:


python3 -m http.server 8000
Open http://localhost:8080 (or http://localhost:8000) in a browser.
Interact with the buttons, slideshow, tabs, and form to test the features.

 Notes
The code is modular, well-commented, and follows best practices for user experience.
Placeholder images are used for the slideshow; replace with real images for production.
The project is extensible for additional features like animations or advanced validation.

 Final Thoughts
This project was a fun dive into JavaScript interactivity! It creates a magical user experience with dynamic elements and real-time feedback. Happy coding!
